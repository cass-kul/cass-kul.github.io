Are you wondering what these strings and numbers prefixed with `0x` (like `0x10` or `0xdeadbeef`) mean? These are **hexadecimal numbers**. Instead of using the common base 10 encoding, these numbers use a base 16 encoding, just like binary numbers use base 2 encoding.

If you want to learn more, you can find a very good tutorial about hexadecimal numbers [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hexadecimal/all)!
